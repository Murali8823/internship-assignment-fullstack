# Internship Assignment - Full-Stack Application

This project is a full-stack application consisting of a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Murali8823/internship-assignment-fullstack.git
cd internship-assignment-fullstack
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend (Server)

In a new terminal window, navigate to the `server` directory and install its dependencies.

```sh
cd server
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start the backend server:

```sh
node index.js
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (Client)

In a separate terminal window, navigate to the `client` directory and install its dependencies.

```sh
cd client
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start the React development server:

```sh
npm start
```

The frontend will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
